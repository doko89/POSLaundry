The `role` column is added to the `users` table in the migration file `database/migrations/2024_01_01_000002_add_worker_fields_to_users_table.php`.

To ensure the database schema is up-to-date, please run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

If you have already run the migrations, and the `role` column is still not present in your database, please double-check your database connection settings in your `.env` file. Also, ensure you are checking the correct database.
