I cannot directly access your database. You will need to check the `users` table yourself. You can do this using a database management tool like phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, or the MySQL command-line client.

Alternatively, if you are comfortable using the command line, you can use Laravel's Tinker to check the user's role. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then, in the Tinker shell, you can retrieve the user (replace '1' with the actual user ID) and check their role:

```php
$user = App\Models\User::find(1);
echo $user->role;
```

Please check the `role` value for the user you are using to access `/admin/dashboard`. It should be 'admin'.
